Part 1: A team of two
=====================

In this tutorial, we will create the scenario of two agents co-operating to find, grab and deliver a certain sequence
of blocks. The two agents are autonomous, thus no human agents are involved in this tutorial. We will cover the implementation
of the block-gathering agent brain, and handle the communication between the two agents. Basic actions like building a
world and adding objects and agents to the world are assumed to be prior knowledge for this creating this scenario.

In this scenario, there are 4 rooms, each containing a certain color of blocks. Each room contains one door. The agents
cannot see what is inside a room before the door is opened. Together, the agents have to deliver a sequence of blocks
to a designated delivery area. The sequence is specified by the user. Once all blocks in the sequence have successfully
been delivered, the simulation is over.

The image below shows what the scene created during the tutorial looks like. Having trouble building this world? Check

One could also put blocks of different random colors in one room, but handling that would require a different strategy than the one executed here.
