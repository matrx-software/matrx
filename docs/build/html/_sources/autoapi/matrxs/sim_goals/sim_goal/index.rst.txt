   .. method:: goal_reached(self, grid_world)


      Returns whether the global goal of the simulated grid world is accomplished. This method should be overridden
      by a new goal function.
      :param grid_world: An up to date representation of the grid world that will be analyzed in this function on
      whether a specific coded global goal is reached.
      :return: True when the goal is reached, False otherwise.

   .. method:: get_progress(self, grid_world)


      Returns the progress of reaching the global goal in the simulated grid world. This method can be overridden
      if you want to track the progress. But is not required.
      :param grid_world: An up to date representation of the grid world that will be analyzed in this function on
      how far we are in obtaining the global simulation goal.
      :return: A Float representing with 0.0 no progress made, and 1.0 that the goal is reached.

   Bases: :class:`matrxs.sim_goals.sim_goal.SimulationGoal`
