About MATRXS
============

Man-Agent Teaming; Rapid Experimentation Software (MATRXS) is a 2D-discrete testbed to facilitate research in human-agent
teaming and provides possibilities for many
different use cases, but its base case rests on the development of methods to generate explanations about the behaviour
of autonomous systems. One of the uses of MATRXS is an urban search-and-rescue operation where a human agent (or a team
of human agents) and an autonomous system (or multiple systems) have to assess the situation and prevent disastrous
consequences. This simulation should contribute to the XAI methods that are being developed at TNO in order to clarify
a system's behaviour to its human user(s).

The entirety of the back-end development of MATRXS is done in Python (3.7) and adheres to an object-oriented programming
style. The visualisation of behaviour is done by using a combination of JavaScript, HTML and CSS via a Flask server.
