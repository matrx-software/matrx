# Testbed

2D-discrete testbed to facilitate HAT-research, with SAIL connection

For documentation see the wiki at [https://ci.tno.nl/gitlab/SAIL-framework/testbed/wikis/home](https://ci.tno.nl/gitlab/SAIL-framework/testbed/wikis/home).

# Changes
- run_sail_api -> run_matrxs_api
- maybe check navigator -> traversable objs (smoke) overwrote intravers objs (wall). Agent got stuck in infinite try walk through wall loop.



# Todo:
- fix bg colour
- fix bg img
- fix userinput
- fix agent / human views
- issue: how to make settings available via the API (e.g. bg_img), such that
- users / agents can edit it, and users / agents can also add extra info.
