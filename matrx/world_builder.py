        objects and/or agents.

        Parameters
        ----------
        shape : tuple or list
            Denotes the width and height of the world you create.

        tick_duration : float (optional, default 0.5)
            The duration of a single 'tick' or loop in the game-loop of the
            world you create.

        random_seed : int, (optional, default 1)
            The master random seed on which all objects, agents and worlds are
            seeded. Should be a positive non-zero integer.

        simulation_goal : WorldGoal, int, list or tuple (optional, default 1000)
            The goal or goals of the world, either a single `WorldGoal`, a
            list of such or a positive non-zero integer to denote the maximum
            number of 'ticks' the world(s) has to run.

        run_matrx_api: bool (optional, default True)
            Whether to run the API. This API is used to connect the default
            MATRX visualizer or a custom one.

        run_matrx_visualizer : bool (optional, default False)
            Whether to run the default MATRX visualizer, this requires the API
            to be run. When set to True, it starts the visualization that is
            accessible through http://localhost:3000.

        visualization_bg_clr : string (optional, default "C2C2C2")
            The color of the world when visualized using MATRX' own
            visualisation server. A string representation of hexadecimal color.

        visualization_bg_img : string (optional, None)
            An optional background image of the world when visualized using
            MATRX' own visualisation server. A string of the path to the image
            file. When None, no background image is used.

        verbose : bool (optional, False)
            Whether the subsequent created world should be verbose or not.

        Raises
        ------
        ValueError

        Parameters
        ----------
        location : tuple or list
            The location (x,y) of the to be added agent.

        agent_brain : AgentBrain
            The AgentBrain instance that will control the agent.

        name : string
            The name of the agent, should be unique to allow the visualisation
            to have a single web page per agent. If the name is already used,
            an exception is thrown.

        customizable_properties : list (optional, None)
            A list or tuple of names of properties for this agent that can be
            altered or customized. Either by the agent itself or by other
            agents or objects. If a property value gets changed that is not
            in this list than an exception is thrown.

        sense_capability : SenseCapability (optional, None)
            The SenseCapability object belonging this this agent's AgentBody.
            Used by the GridWorld to pre-filter objects and agents from this
            agent's states when querying for actions. Defaults to a
            SenseCapability that sees all object types within the entire world.

        is_traversable : bool (optional, None)
            Denotes whether other agents and object can move over this agent.
            It also throws an exception when this is set to False and another
            object/agent with this set to False is added to the same location.

        team : string (optional, None)
            The team name. Used to group agents together. Defaults to this
            agent's name + "_team" to signify it forms its own team.

        possible_actions : list (optional, None)
            A list or tuple of the names of the Action classes this agent can
            perform. With this you can limit the actions this agent can
            perform.

        is_movable : bool (optional, None)
            Whether this agent can be moved by other agents (currently this
            only happens with the DropObjectAction and PickUpAction).

        visualize_size : float (optional, None)
            The size of this agent in its visualisation. A value of 1.0
            denotes the full grid location square, whereas a value of 0.5
            denotes half, and 0.0 an infinitesimal small size.

        visualize_shape : int or string (optional, None)
            The shape of this agent in its visualisation. Depending on the
            value it obtains this shape:

            * 0 = a square

            * 1 = a triangle

            * 2 = a circle

            * Path to image or GIF = that image scaled to match the size.

        visualize_colour : string (optional, None)

        This methods adds an agent body to every created world at the specified
        location and linked to an instance of the provided agent brain. It does
        so based on the provided probability. Meaning that there is
        `probability` chance that the agent will be added on the specified
        location.

        All keyword parameters default to None. Which means that their values
        are obtained from their similar named constants in `matrx.defaults`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        location : tuple or list
            The location (x,y) of the to be added agent.

            The AgentBrain instance that will control the agent.

        probability : float
            A float between 0.0 and 1.0. Denotes the probability with which
            to add this agent when a world is created.

        name : string
            The name of the agent, should be unique to allow the visualisation
            to have a single web page per agent. If the name is already used,
            an exception is thrown.

        customizable_properties : list (optional, None)
            A list or tuple of names of properties for this agent that can be
            altered or customized. Either by the agent itself or by other
            agents or objects. If a property value gets changed that is not
            in this list than an exception is thrown.

        sense_capability : SenseCapability (optional, None)
            The SenseCapability object belonging this this agent's AgentBody.
            Used by the GridWorld to pre-filter objects and agents from this
            agent's states when querying for actions. Defaults to a
            SenseCapability that sees all object types within the entire world.

        is_traversable : bool (optional, None)
            Denotes whether other agents and object can move over this agent.
            It also throws an exception when this is set to False and another
            object/agent with this set to False is added to the same location.

        team : string (optional, None)
            The team name. Used to group agents together. Defaults to this
            agent's name + "_team" to signify it forms its own team.

            * Path to image or GIF = that image scaled to match the size.

        visualize_colour : string (optional, None)
            The colour of this agent in its visualisation. Should be a string
            hexadecimal colour value.

            means show this using a loading icon, false means do not show
            this in the visualizer.

        **custom_properties : dict (optional, None)
            Any additional given keyword arguments will be encapsulated in
            this dictionary. These will be added to the AgentBody as

        This methods adds an agent body to every created world at the specified
        location and linked to an instance of a `HumanAgentBrain` which handles
        user input as received from a visualisation.

        All keyword parameters default to None. Which means that their values
        are obtained from their similar named constants in `matrx.defaults`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        location : tuple or list
            The location (x,y) of the to be added agent.

        agent : HumanAgentBrain
            The human agent brain that is linked to this agent. Should be of
            type `HumanAgentBrain` or inherit from it.

        name : string (optional, default "HumanAgent")
            The name of the agent, should be unique to allow the visualisation
            to have a single web page per agent. If the name is already used,
            an exception is raised.

        customizable_properties : list (optional, None)
            A list or tuple of names of properties for this agent that can be
            altered or customized. Either by the agent itself or by other
            agents or objects. If a property value gets changed that is not
            in this list than an exception is thrown.

        sense_capability : SenseCapability (optional, None)
            The SenseCapability object belonging this this agent's AgentBody.
            Used by the GridWorld to pre-filter objects and agents from this
            agent's states when querying for actions. Defaults to a
            SenseCapability that sees all object types within the entire world.

        is_traversable : bool (optional, None)
            Denotes whether other agents and object can move over this agent.
            It also throws an exception when this is set to False and another
            object/agent with this set to False is added to the same location.

        team : string (optional, None)
            The team name. Used to group agents together. Defaults to this
            agent's name + "_team" to signify it forms its own team.

        possible_actions : list (optional, None)
            A list or tuple of the names of the Action classes this agent can
            perform. With this you can limit the actions this agent can
            perform.

        is_movable : bool (optional, None)
            Whether this agent can be moved by other agents (currently this
            only happens with the DropObjectAction and PickUpAction).

        visualize_size : float (optional, None)
            The size of this agent in its visualisation. A value of 1.0
            denotes the full grid location square, whereas a value of 0.5
            denotes half, and 0.0 an infinitesimal small size.

        visualize_shape : int or string (optional, None)
            The shape of this agent in its visualisation. Depending on the
            value it obtains this shape:

            * 0 = a square

            * 1 = a triangle

            * 2 = a circle

            * Path to image or GIF = that image scaled to match the size.

        visualize_colour : string (optional, None)
            The colour of this agent in its visualisation. Should be a string
            hexadecimal colour value.

        visualize_depth : int (optional, None)
            The visualisation depth of this agent in its visualisation. It
            denotes the 'layer' on which it is visualized. A larger value is
            more on 'top'.

        visualize_opacity : float (optional, None)
            The opacity of this agent in its visualization. A value of 1.0
            means full opacity and 0.0 no opacity.

        visualize_when_busy : bool (optional, None)
            Whether to visualize when an agent is busy with a action. True
            means show this using a loading icon, false means do not show
            this in the visualizer.

        key_action_map : dict (optional, None)
            A dictionary that maps keyboard keys in ASCII to action classes. It
            can be used to translate keystrokes to the agent performing a
            certain action.

        **custom_properties : dict (optional, None)
            Any additional given keyword arguments will be encapsulated in
            this dictionary. These will be added to the AgentBody as
            custom_properties which can be perceived by other agents and
            objects or which can be used or altered (if allowed to by the
            customizable_properties list) by the AgentBrain or others.

        Raises
        ------
            ValueError
                When an agent with the given name was already added previously.
                When the `agent` parameter does not inherits from
                `HumanAgentBrain`

        """ Adds a goal to the world to collect objects and drop them in a specific area.

        This is a helper method to quickly add a `CollectionGoal` to the world. A `CollectionGoal` will check if a set of
        objects with certain property-value combinations are at specified locations (potentially in a fixed order). To do
        so, location(s) need to be specified that function as such a "drop off zone". This method add to those locations a
        `CollectionDropOffTile` object, which are searched by the `CollectionGoal` and checks if there the specified objects
        are at those tiles.

        In addition, this method receives a list of dictionaries that represent the kind of objects that need to be
        collected. Since objects are described as a set of properties and their values, these dictionaries contain such
        property-value pairs (with the property names as keys, and their values as values).

        Finally, this method adds a `CollectionGoal` that links these collection tiles and the requested objects. This goal
        checks at each tick if the requested objects are at the specified location(s). If multiple locations are given, the
        requested objects can be spread out over all of those locations! For example, if a Red Block and Blue Block need to
        be collected on locations (0, 0) and  (1, 0), the goal will be accomplished if both blocks are at either location
        but also when the Red Block is at (0, 0) and the Blue Block is at (1, 0) or vice versa.

        Parameters
        ----------
        collection_locs : (x, y) or list/tuple of (x, y)
            A single location where the objects need to be collected, or a list/tuple of such locations. A location is a
            list/tuple of two integers, the x- and y-coordinates respectively.
        collection_objects : list/tuple of dicts, or a RandomProperty with such list/tuple
            A list or tuple of dictionaries. Each dictionary represents a the properties and their respective values that
            identify the to be collected object. It can also be a RandomProperty with as values such a list/tuple. This can
            be used to generate a different collection_objects per world creation.
        name : str
            The name of the `CollectionGoal` and the added `CollectionTarget` and `CollectionDropOffTile` objects.
        in_order : bool (default is False)
            Whether the objects need to be collected and dropped of in the order specified by the `collection_objects` list.
            If all objects are present but not dropped in the right order, the goal will not be accomplished if this is set
            to True.
        collection_area_colour : str (default is )
            The colour of the area on the specified locations representing the drop zone.
        collection_area_opacity : float (default is 1.0)
            The opacity of the area on the specified locations representing the drop zone.
        overwrite_goals : bool (default is False)
            Whether any previously added goals to the builder should be discarded/overwritten.

        Examples
        --------
        Add a collection gaol that requires agents to collect 2 objects in order. The first with the color "#ff0000" (red)
        and the second with the color "#0000ff" (blue). Objects can be dropped at either location (0, 0) or (1, 0). The drop
        off are is called "Dropzone".

        >>> builder.add_collection_goal("Dropzone", [(0, 0), (1, 0)], order, in_order=True)

        Add two collection goals, each with the same collection zone. The first goal needs to collect two objects with the
        colours "#ff0000" (red) and "##0000ff" (blue). The second goal needs to collect two objects with the custom property
        "is_candy" set to True. Both goals can be satisfied by dropping a red and blue candy, or by dropping a red and blue
        object that are not candies, and two candies with different colours than red or blue.
        >>> colored_objects = [{"visualize_colour": "#ff0000"}, {"visualize_colour": "#0000ff"}]
        >>> builder.add_collection_goal("Colours", [(0, 0), (1, 0)], colored_objects)

        >>> builder.add_collection_goal("Candies", [(0, 0), (1, 0)], candy_objects)

        Add a collection goal to collect a red and blue candy but in a different order every time a world is created. The
        two orders defined here are: first red, then blue OR first blue then red.
        >>> different_orders = [[{"visualize_colour": "#ff0000"}, {"visualize_colour": "#0000ff"}], \

        Notes
        -----
        It is important remember that objects might not be traversable, which prevents them from stacking. So if a goal is
        made that request 2 objects to be collected on the same location where both objects are not traversable, the goal
        will never be able to succeed.

        See Also
        --------
