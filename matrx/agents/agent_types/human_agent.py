        part is executed.

        This is the Observe phase. In this phase you filter the state

        see. Since the grid world returns ALL properties of ALL objects

        For the default MATRX visualization, the context menu is opened by
        right clicking on an object. This function should generate a list of
        options (actions, messages, or something else) which relate to that
        object or location. Each option is in the shape of a text shown in the
        context menu, and a message which is send to this agent if the user
        actually clicks that context menu option.

        Parameters
        ----------
        agent_id_who_clicked : str
            The ID of the (human) agent that selected this agent and requested
            for a context menu.
        clicked_object_id : str
            A string indicating the ID of an object. Is None if the user
            clicked on a background tile (which has no ID).
        click_location : list
            A list containing the [x,y] coordinates of the object on which the
            user right clicked.

        Returns
        -------
         context_menu : list
            A list containing context menu items. Each context menu item is a
            dict with a 'OptionText' key, which is the text shown in the menu
            for the option, and a 'Message' key, which is the message instance
            that is sent to this agent when the user clicks on the context
            menu option.
