class Navigator:
    """ A navigator object that can be used for path planning and navigation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    agent_id: string
        ID of the agent that wants to navigate through a grid world.
    action_set: list
        List of actions the agent can perform.
    algorithm: string. Optional, default "a_star"
        The path planning algorithm to use. As of now only A* is supported.
    is_circular: bool (Default: False)
        When True, it will continuously navigate given waypoints, until infinity.

    Warnings
    --------
    This class still depends on the deprecated `StateTracker` instead of the new `State`. Note that the `StateTracker`
    is created from a state dictionary that can be obtained from a `State` instance. This is the current workaround to
    still make the `Navigator` work with the current `State`.

    Another approach is to not use `State` at all, and only rely on a `StateTracker`. See the
    :class:`matrx.agents.agent_types.patrolling_agent.PatrollingAgentBrain` which uses this approach.
