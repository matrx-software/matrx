        RandomProperty
            A random property representing all possible lists of collection objects. Each list differs in the order of
            the objects. If length < len(possibilities), not all objects may be in each list. If with_duplicates=True,
            some objects might occur more than once in a list. This random property can be given to a `CollectionGoal`
            who will sample one of these lists every time a world is run. This allows a world with a `CollectionGoal`
            to denote different collection goals each time but still based on all properties in `possibilities`.

        Examples
        --------
        >>> from matrx import WorldBuilder
        >>> from matrx.logger import LogActions
        >>> from matrx.objects import SquareBlock
        >>> from matrx.goals import CollectionGoal

        >>> builder.add_object([1, 1], "Blue Block", callable_class=SquareBlock, visualize_colour="#3385e8")

        Add a collection goal, where we should collect red and blue blocks but every time we run the world, in a different
         order. To do so, we need to pass a RandomProperty to `add_collection_goal` which it uses to sample such an
         order each created world. We call this utility method to get us such a RandomProperty.
        >>> rp_order = CollectionGoal.get_random_order_property([{'visualize_colour': 'eb4034'}, {'visualize_colour': '3385e8'}])
        >>> builder.add_collection_goal("Drop", [(2, 2)], rp_order, in_order=True)

        Parameters

        possibilities: iterable
            An iterable (e.g. list, tuple, etc.) of dictionaries representing property_name, property_value pairs that
            can be collected.

            Whether entries in `possibilities` can occur more than once in the lists.

        Returns
        -------
        RandomProperty
            A random property representing all possible lists of collection objects. Each list differs in the order of
            the objects. If length < len(possibilities), not all objects may be in each list. If with_duplicates=True,
            some objects might occur more than once in a list. This random property can be given to a `CollectionGoal`
            who will sample one of these lists every time a world is run. This allows a world with a `CollectionGoal`
            to denote different collection goals each time but still based on all properties in `possibilities`.

        Examples
        --------
        >>> from matrx import WorldBuilder
        >>> from matrx.logger import LogActions
        >>> from matrx.objects import SquareBlock
        >>> from matrx.goals import CollectionGoal
        >>> builder = WorldBuilder(shape=(3, 3))
        >>> builder.add_object([0, 0], "Red Block", callable_class=SquareBlock, visualize_colour="#eb4034")
        >>> builder.add_object([1, 1], "Blue Block", callable_class=SquareBlock, visualize_colour="#3385e8")

        Add a collection goal, where we should collect red and blue blocks but every time we run the world, in a different
         order. To do so, we need to pass a RandomProperty to `add_collection_goal` which it uses to sample such an
         order each created world. We call this utility method to get us such a RandomProperty.
        >>> rp_order = CollectionGoal.get_random_order_property([{'visualize_colour': 'eb4034'}, {'visualize_colour': '3385e8'}])
        >>> builder.add_collection_goal("Drop", [(2, 2)], rp_order, in_order=True)
