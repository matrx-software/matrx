        Parameters
        ----------
        shape : tuple or list
           Denotes the width and height of the world you create.

        tick_duration : float
           The duration of a single 'tick' or loop in the game-loop of the
           world you create.

        simulation_goal : WorldGoal, int, list or tuple
           The goal or goals of the world, either a single `WorldGoal`, a
           list of such or a positive non-zero integer to denote the maximum
           number of 'ticks' the world(s) has to run.

        rnd_seed : bool (optional, default, 1)
            The master random seed set by the WorldBuilder on which all objects, agents and worlds are
            seeded. Should be a positive non-zero integer.

        visualization_bg_clr : string (optional, "C2C2C2")
           The color of the world when visualized using MATRX' own
           visualisation server. A string representation of hexadecimal color.

        visualization_bg_img : string (optional, None)
           An optional background image of the world when visualized using
           MATRX' own visualisation server. A string of the path to the image
           file. When None, no background image is used.

        verbose : bool (optional, False)
           Whether the GridWorld should be verbose and print development logs to the console.

        world_id : int (optional, 0)
           The ID of this world. Every new GridWorld instance should have a unique ID, such that the frontend knows
           when it has to reinitialize the visualization.
