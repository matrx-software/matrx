""" Main module for the core's Action class.
"""


class Action:
    """ Contains the effects of an action on the world.

    This class is empty and should be overridden if you want to make a
    new action that is not yet supported. You may also extend other
    actions, but all MATRX' actions inherit from this class.

    Parameters
    ----------
    duration_in_ticks : int
        Optional, default: ``1``. Should be zero or larger.

        The default duration of this action in ticks during which the
        :class:`matrx.grid_world.GridWorld` blocks the agent performing other
        actions. By default this is 1, meaning that all actions of this type will take
        both the tick in which it was decided upon and the subsequent tick.
        When the agent is blocked / busy with an action, only the
        :meth:`matrx.agents.agent_brain.AgentBrain.filter_observations` method is called for that agent, and the
        :meth:`matrx.agents.agent_brain.AgentBrain.decide_on_action` method is skipped.
        This means that agents that are busy with an action can only perceive the world but not decide on
        a new action untill the action has completed.

        An agent can overwrite the duration of an action by returning the ``action_duration`` in the ``action_kwargs``
        in the :meth:`matrx.agents.agent_brain.AgentBrain.decide_on_action` method, as so:
        ``return >action_name<, {'action_duration': >ticks<}``

    """

    def __init__(self, duration_in_ticks=0):
        # number of ticks the action takes to complete
        self.duration_in_ticks = duration_in_ticks

    def mutate(self, grid_world, agent_id, world_state, **kwargs):
        """ Method that mutates the world.

        This method is allowed to mutate a :class:`matrx.grid_world.GridWorld`
        instance according to the purposes of the
        :class:`matrx.actions.Action`. Override this method when implementing
        a new :class:`matrx.actions.action.Action`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        grid_world : GridWorld
            The GridWorld instance that should be mutated according to the
            Action's intended purpose.
        agent_id : string
            The unique identifier of the agent performing this action.
        world_state : State
            The State object representing the entire world. Can be used to
            simplify search of objects and properties when performing an
            action. Note that this is the State of the entire world, not
            that of the agent performing the action.
        **kwargs
            The set of keyword arguments provided by the agent that decided
            upon this action. When overriding this method and setting required
            arguments, the :class:`matrx.grid_world.GridWorld` will take
            responsibility in checking whether the agent provided these. Hence,
            it is not required to do so here.

        Returns
        -------
        ActionResult
            An instance of the :class:`matrx.actions.Action.ActionResult`
            class, or an inherited class thereof, which denotes whether the
            mutation actually succeeded or not, together with the reason why.
            This result is passed to the
            :class:`matrx.agents.agent_brain.AgentBrain` by the
            :class:`matrx.grid_world.GridWorld` instance so that an agent is
            capable of checking when and why an
            :class:`matrx.actions.action.Action` succeeded or failed.

        Notes
        -----
        This method is called by the :class:`matrx.grid_world.GridWorld` iff:

        * An :class:`matrx.agents.agent_brain.AgentBrain` of an agent decided
          upon this action.
        * It is the turn of the agent to take an action.
        * The implemented :meth:`matrx.actions.Action.is_possible` method
          returned an :class:`matrx.actions.Action.ActionResult.succeeded`
          denoting success.
        * The `action_duration` has passed.

        Furthermore, it is important to remember that the given
        :class:matrx.grid_world.GridWorld` instance, represents the actual
        world. Any change to this instance are immediately reflected in the
        world.

    def is_possible(self, grid_world, agent_id, world_state, **kwargs):
        """ Checks if the Action is possible.

        This method analyses a :class:`matrx.grid_world.GridWorld` instance
        to check if the Action is possible to perform. Override this method
        when implementing a new :class:`matrx.actions.action.Action`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        grid_world : GridWorld
            The GridWorld instance that should be used to check if this Action
            is possible.
        agent_id : string
            The unique identifier of the agent performing this action.

            action can be performed. Note that this is the State of the
            entire world, not that of the agent performing the action.
        kwargs : dictionary
            The set of keyword arguments provided by the Agent that decided
            upon this action. When overriding this method and setting required
            arguments, the GridWorld will take responsibility in checking
            whether the Agent provided these. Hence, it is not required to do
            so here.

        Returns
        -------
        ActionResult
            The expected :class:`matrx.actions.action.ActionResult` when
            performing this :class:`matrx.actions.action.Action`. The
            :attr:`matrx.actions.action.ActionResult.succeeded` attribute is
            used to check if the :class:`matrx.actions.action.Action` is
            indeed possible by the :class:`matrx.grid_world.GridWorld`.

        Notes
        -----
        It is important to understand that this function does not have to
        guarantee the success of an :class:`matrx.actions.action.Action`. It
        might be impossible to check if an
        :class:`matrx.actions.action.Action` would always succeed without
        actually performing the mutation. Hence, this method only needs to
        check for general cases. The
        :meth:`matrx.actions.action.Action.mutate` itself also returns an
        :class:`matrx.actions.action.ActionResult` which denotes the actual
        success or failure of the Action.

        This method is called by the :class:`matrx.grid_world.GridWorld` iff:

        * An :class:`matrx.agents.agent_brain.AgentBrain` of an agent decided
          upon this action.
        * It is the turn of the agent to take an action.
        * The `action_duration` has passed.

        OR

        * An :class:`matrx.agents.agent_brain.AgentBrain` requested if a
          certain :class:`matrx.actions.action.Action` is possible. (Requested
          functionality: See Issue #46)

        Warnings
        --------
        This method should not change anything in this instance. This is
        reserved for the :meth:`matrx.actions.action.Action.mutate` method as
        any change here will be reflected in the world.

class ActionResult:
    """ Represents the generic (expected) result of an action.

    This class functions as a simple wrapper around a boolean representing the
    success (`True`) or failure (`False`) of the (expected) mutation of an
    :class:`matrx.actions.action.Action`, as well as the reason for it.

    The :class:`matrx.actions.action.ActionResult` class contains several
    generic reasons for a succeed or fail as constant class attributes.

    Parameters
    ----------
    result : str
        A string representing the reason for the (expected) success or fail of
        an :class:`matrx.actions.action.Action`.
    succeeded : bool
        A boolean representing the (expected) success or fail of an
        :class:`matrx.actions.action.Action`.

    Notes
    -----
    Both the methods :meth:`matrx.actions.Action.is_possible` and
    :meth:`matrx.actions.Action.mutate` should return an
    :class:`matrx.actions.action.ActionResult`. With the former it represents
    the expected success or failure of the
    :class:`matrx.actions.action.Action`, with the latter the actual success
    or failure.

    The :class:`matrx.actions.action.ActionResult` class contain several
    reasons why an :class:`matrx.actions.action.Action` may succeed or fail
    that are being checked by a :class:`matrx.grid_world.GridWorld` instance.
    These are:

        * IDLE_ACTION: Always given when an AgentBrain decided upon returning
          None (the idle action)
        * AGENT_WAS_REMOVED: Always given when an agent does not exist anymore
          in the GridWorld.
        * AGENT_NOT_CAPABLE: Always given when the Action an AgentBrain decided
          upon is not an Action that agent
          should be capable of.
        * UNKNOWN_ACTION: Always given when the Action name an AgentBrain
          decided upon is not recognized as a class name of an Action or some
          class inheriting from Action. Could be caused by either that class
          not existing or because it is never imported anywhere (and hence is
          not on the path the GridWorld searches in).

    When creating a new :class:`matrx.actions.action.Action` class, you can
    also extend this class with your own. This allows you to set your own
    constants representing reasons for that
    :class:`matrx.actions.action.Action` specific results. This allows an
    :class:`matrx.agents.agent_brain.AgentBrain` to directly match the
    :attr:`matrx.actions.ActionResult.result` with a constant and potentially
    adjust its behavior.
