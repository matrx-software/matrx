    The action that opens a specific door within a given range from the agent.

    Parameters
    ----------
    duration_in_ticks : int
        Optional, default: ``1``. Should be zero or larger.

        The default duration of this action in ticks during which the
        :class:`matrx.grid_world.GridWorld` blocks the agent performing other
        actions. By default this is 1, meaning that all actions of this type will take
        both the tick in which it was decided upon and the subsequent tick.
        When the agent is blocked / busy with an action, only the
        :meth:`matrx.agents.agent_brain.AgentBrain.filter_observations` method is called for that agent, and the
        :meth:`matrx.agents.agent_brain.AgentBrain.decide_on_action` method is skipped.
        This means that agents that are busy with an action can only perceive the world but not decide on
        a new action untill the action has completed.

        An agent can overwrite the duration of an action by returning the ``action_duration`` in the ``action_kwargs``
        in the :meth:`matrx.agents.agent_brain.AgentBrain.decide_on_action` method, as so:
