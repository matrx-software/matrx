class CollectionTarget(EnvObject):

    This invisible object is linked to `CollectionDropOffTile` object(s) and is used by the `CollectionGoal` to
    identify which objects should be collected and dropped off at the tiles. This object is just a regular object
    but contains three additional properties:
    - collection_objects: See parameter doc.
    - collection_zone_name: See parameter doc.
    - is_invisible: A boolean denoting that this object is invisible. This boolean has no effect in MATRX, except to
    denote that this object is not an actual visible object.
    - is_drop_off_target: Denotes this object as containing the descriptions of the to be collected objects.

    The invisibility is implemented as a block with full opacity, not movable, fully traversable and always below
    other objects.

    Parameters
    ----------
    location : (x, y)
        The location of this object.
    collection_objects : List of dicts
        A list of dictionaries, each dictionary in this list represents an object that should be dropped at this
        location. The dictionary itself represents the property-value pairs these objects should adhere to. The
        order of the list matters iff the `CollectionGoal.in_order==True`, in which case the
        `CollectionGoal` will track if the dropped objects at this tile are indeed dropped in the order of the list.
    collection_zone_name : str
        This is the name that links `CollectionDropOffTile` object(s) to this object. The `CollectionGoal` will check
        all of these tiles with this name to check if all objects are already dropped and collected.
    name : str (default is "Collection_target")
        The name of this object.

    Notes
    -----
    It does not matter where this object is added in the world. However, it is good practice to add it on top of
    the (or one of them) `CollectionDropOffTile` object(s). The helper method to create collection areas
    `WorldBuilder.add_collection_goal` follows this practice.
