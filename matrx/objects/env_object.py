class EnvObject:
    """
     The basic class for all objects in the world. This includes the AgentAvatar. All objects that are added to the
     GridWorld should inherit this class.

     An EnvObject always needs a location and a name. Since we have no idea where you want to put the object or how
     you want to call it.

     In addition agents may alter properties of objects, but only if they are specifically told to be customizable.
     This is done by providing a list of property names in the customizable_properties list.
     Any custom property is allowed to be customizable if in that list, but any keyword argument (e.g.
     is_traversable) may only be influenced by an Action indirectly. For example, the is_traversable property cannot
     be changed in any way, whereas the location property can only be changed indirectly through the PickUpObject
     action.

     A few properties are mandatory for the GridWorld, some Actions and the Visualizer to function. These are
     keyword arguments (e.g. is_traversable). If these are not set, they are obtained from the defaults.py file.

     This class specific allows you to create any object you desire that only differs in the properties it holds. For
     example both a simple block or complex object such as a 'fire' can be modeled with this class. They only differ
     in their mandatory and custom properties (a block is simply a colored square, whereas a 'fire' has potentially
     many more properties). In such a case you simply provide more keyword arguments to the constructor, these
     are automatically added to the self.custom_attributes dictionary. Allowing you to intuitively extend the
     properties of any EnvObject.

     If you want an object that can be altered by an action in a specific way, you can create it as long as it
     inherits from this class. For example the Door object is such an example which has a unique method that 'opens'
     or 'closes' the door. Which is called by the OpenDoor and CloseDoor actions.

     If you want an object that needs to update some of its own properties during the simulation, you can again
     create your own object as long as it inherits from this class. Then you can implement the update_properties
     method. The Battery object is such an example, which simply decreases its energy level property each time step.

     If you have a specific object you need to create a lot and you do not want to keep on setting every property
     every time for the custom_properties, you can make your own class again which must inherit from this class and
     only implement its constructor where these custom properties are set with your default value
     of choosing.

    Parameters
    ----------
    name : String
        The name of object, does not need to be unique.
    location : List or tuple of length two
        The location of the object in the grid world.
    customizable_properties : List. Optional, default obtained from defaults.py
        The list of attribute names
        that can be customized by other objects (including AgentAvatars and as an extension any Agent).
    is_traversable : Boolean. Optional, default obtained from defaults.py
        Signals whether other objects can be placed on top of this object.
    carried_by : List. Optional, default obtained from defaults.py
        A list of who is carrying this object.
    class_callable : Callable class. Optional, defaults to EnvObject
        This is required to make a distinction
        between what kind of object is actually seen or visualized. The last element is always the lowest level class,
        whereas the first element is always EnvObject and everything in between are potential other classes in the
        inheritance chain.
    visualize_size : Float. Optional, default obtained from defaults.py
        A visualization property used by
        the Visualizer. Denotes the size of the object, its unit is a single grid square in the visualization (e.g. a
        value of 0.5 is half of a square, object is in the center, a value of 2 is twice the square's size centered on
        its location.)
    visualize_shape : Int. Optional, default obtained from defaults.py
        A visualization property used by the
        Visualizer. Denotes the shape of the object in the visualization. 0=Rectangle, 1=Triangle, 2=Circle
    visualize_colour : Hexcode string. Optional, default obtained from defaults.py
        A visualization property
        used by the Visualizer. Denotes the colour of the object in visualization.
    visualize_depth : Integer. Optional, default obtained from defaults.py
        A visualization property that
        is used by the Visualizer to draw objects in layers.
    visualize_opacity : Integer. Optional, default obtained from defaults.py
        Opacity of the object. From 0.0 to 1.0.
    visualize_from_center: Boolean. Optional, by default True. 
        Whether an object should be visualized and scaled from its center point, or top left point. 
    **custom_properties : Dict. Optional
        Any other keyword arguments. All these are treated as custom attributes.
        For example the property 'heat'=2.4 of an EnvObject representing a fire.
